# Clean
## A theme for BetterDiscord and Vencord

The objective of this project is to provide a minimalist design theme that emulates the color palette and aesthetic sensibilities of the Github Dark, while also utilizing a font that is both elegant and refined in its design.

It also removes profile effects from user profiles by default.
